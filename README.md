### Hi there 👋

What can I say about myself? Uh...Let's just say that I'm passionate about computers in general, but especially about everything that revolves around DevOps and security. 🐱‍👤

I have to say, as I'm a somewhat undecided person, I like to juggle between development and infrastructure and sometimes I mix the two. 🐱‍🏍
